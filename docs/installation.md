# BigaOS Installation Guide

Complete guide for installing BigaOS on a Raspberry Pi. Covers initial OS setup, optional NVMe boot, and BigaOS installation.

## Requirements

### Hardware
- Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 (RPi 5 recommended)
- MicroSD card (16GB+ recommended)
- Ethernet cable or WiFi connection
- Power supply (official RPi USB-C PSU recommended)

### Optional Hardware
- NVMe SSD + M.2 HAT/base board (for faster storage and more space)
- MacArthur HAT (for NMEA 2000 connectivity)

### Software
- [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) (on your PC)
- SSH client (built into Windows 10+, macOS, Linux)

## Step 1: Flash Raspberry Pi OS

1. Insert your **MicroSD card** into your PC
2. Open **Raspberry Pi Imager**
3. Choose device: **Raspberry Pi 5** (or your model)
4. Choose OS: **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)** (under "Raspberry Pi OS (other)")
5. Choose storage: your MicroSD card
6. Click **Next**
7. When prompted "Would you like to apply OS customisation settings?", click **Edit Settings** and configure:
   - **Hostname:** your preference (e.g. `bigaos`)
   - **Username:** your preference (e.g. `bigaos`)
   - **Password:** choose a secure password
   - **WiFi:** configure if not using ethernet
   - **Locale:** set your timezone
   - Under the **Services** tab: enable **SSH** with password authentication
8. Click **Save**, then **Yes** to apply the settings
9. Confirm the write and wait for it to finish

## Step 2: First Boot

1. Insert the MicroSD card into the Raspberry Pi
2. Connect ethernet (if not using WiFi)
3. Connect power
4. Wait ~60 seconds for the first boot to complete

### Connect via SSH

Replace `<user>` and `<hostname>` with the values you set in the imager:
```bash
ssh <user>@<hostname>.local
```

If the hostname doesn't resolve, find the Pi's IP address from your router's admin page and use that instead:
```bash
ssh <user>@192.168.x.x
```

### Update the system (recommended)

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

This ensures you have the latest security patches before installing BigaOS. Not strictly required, but recommended.

## Step 3 (Optional): Boot from NVMe SSD

Skip this section if you don't have an NVMe drive. BigaOS runs fine from an SD card.

An NVMe SSD provides significantly faster read/write speeds and more storage. This step clones your SD card to the NVMe and configures the Pi to boot from it.

### Prerequisites
- NVMe SSD installed in an M.2 HAT or base board connected to the Pi
- Pi is currently booted from the SD card

### Clone SD to NVMe

```bash
# Verify both drives are visible
lsblk
# You should see mmcblk0 (SD card) and nvme0n1 (NVMe)

# Clone the SD card to the NVMe
sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/dev/nvme0n1 bs=4M status=progress

# Expand the root partition to use the full NVMe
sudo parted /dev/nvme0n1 resizepart 2 100%
sudo e2fsck -fy /dev/nvme0n1p2
sudo resize2fs /dev/nvme0n1p2

# Set boot order to NVMe first
sudo raspi-config nonint do_boot_order B2

# Shut down
sudo shutdown -h now
```

### Switch to NVMe

1. **Remove the SD card** from the Pi
2. **Power on** the Pi
3. Wait ~30 seconds, then SSH back in:
   ```bash
   ssh <user>@<hostname>.local
   ```
4. Verify you're running from NVMe:
   ```bash
   lsblk
   # Root (/) should be on nvme0n1p2
   findmnt /
   ```

> **Tip:** Keep the SD card as a recovery tool. If the NVMe ever has boot issues, insert the SD card, change boot order back to SD (`sudo raspi-config nonint do_boot_order B1`), reboot, and you can mount and fix the NVMe from there.

## Step 4: Install BigaOS

With the Pi booted and SSH connected, run the one-line installer:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BigaOSTeam/BigaOS/main/install.sh | bash
```

This will:
- Install Node.js 20 LTS (if not already installed)
- Download the latest BigaOS release
- Install server dependencies
- Create and enable a systemd service
- Configure sudoers for self-update capability
- Start BigaOS

The installer takes 2-5 minutes depending on your internet speed.

### Access BigaOS

Once installed, open a browser on any device on the same network and go to:

```
http://<hostname>.local:3000
```

Or use the Pi's IP address:
```
http://192.168.x.x:3000
```

## Useful Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `sudo systemctl status bigaos` | Check if BigaOS is running |
| `sudo systemctl restart bigaos` | Restart BigaOS |
| `sudo systemctl stop bigaos` | Stop BigaOS |
| `sudo journalctl -u bigaos -f` | View live logs |
| `sudo journalctl -u bigaos --since "1 hour ago"` | View recent logs |
| `bash ~/BigaOS/install.sh` | Manually trigger an update |

---

## Updating BigaOS

BigaOS checks for updates automatically every 6 hours. When an update is available, it will appear in **Settings > System**. Click **Update** to install it.

You can also update manually via SSH:
```bash
bash ~/BigaOS/install.sh
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Can't find the Pi on the network
- Make sure the Pi has finished booting (wait 60 seconds)
- Try `ping bigaos.local` from your PC
- Check your router's DHCP client list for the Pi's IP
- If using WiFi, verify the credentials were entered correctly in Raspberry Pi Imager

### BigaOS won't start
```bash
# Check the service status
sudo systemctl status bigaos

# View the error logs
sudo journalctl -u bigaos --no-pager -n 50
```

### NVMe drive not detected
```bash
# Check if the drive appears
lsblk
ls /dev/nvme*

# Check kernel messages for NVMe errors
dmesg | grep -i nvme
```

### Pi won't boot from NVMe
1. Insert the SD card back into the Pi
2. Change boot order back to SD: `sudo raspi-config nonint do_boot_order B1`
3. Reboot, then mount and inspect the NVMe:
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p2 /mnt
   sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot/firmware
   cat /mnt/boot/firmware/config.txt
   cat /mnt/etc/fstab
   ```
4. Fix any issues, unmount, change boot order back to NVMe, remove SD card, and reboot
